Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat!

Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ‚ô• I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too.

Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside. Her ears are the most unique pointy to the sides unlike her siblings and she loves any kind of food you serve her. Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings.

She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained.

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy.

So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs. We understand that there might be many terms and conditions, but we want the best for her.",66ad04874,4.0,4,Black,Cream,White,American Shorthair,American Shorthair,Selangor

She has done all 3 vaccinations and have fininshed her medications for heart worm which lasted for 6 months. She's an active happy puppy who loves the outdoors. She's quite scared of other dogs but once she's slowly introduced to them she get excited playing with them. She got along with my female german shepherd very well. She's indoor self trained pup. The moment we brought her in we see where she usually does her business and from there we put her pee pad or pee pan and she continuously goes back to the same place. Smart dog knows simple commands (sit, paw, down) Usually only when there's food around. She love her naps and usually sleeps facing upwards which is quite cute.

She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.
